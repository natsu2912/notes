# On 32 bit system
Heap Architecture of a non-free block:
		-----	Meta data	-----
	1. Current block size + prev_in_use_bit (4 bytes) Ex: size = 0x16, prev_in_use_bit = 0x1, this part = 0x17
		-----	  Data 		-----
	2. Data of current block

Heap Architecture ofe a free lock:
		----- 	Meta data 	-----
	1. Previous block size (4 bytes)
	2. Current block size + prev_in_use_bit (4 bytes)
		-----	FWD & BCK 	-----
	3. Pointer to FWD (use for unlink() function in malloc(), it is actually use for linked list)
	4. Pointer to BCK (use for unlink() function in malloc(), it is actually use for linked list)
	
At the end of heap, there is a final block:
	1.	Previous block size (4 bytes)
	2. 	The remaining size of heap + prev_in_use_bit (4 bytes)
